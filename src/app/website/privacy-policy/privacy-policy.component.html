          <h5 class="section-title">How We Use Collected Information</h5>
          <p>
            We use your personal information for purposes such as improving services, communicating with you, processing

            fraud.
          </p>

          <h5 class="section-title">How Information is Shared</h5>
          <p>
            Your information may be shared with trusted third-party service providers who assist in our operations, such
            as payment processors and analytics partners. We will also share data if legally required to do so, or in
            the event of a corporate restructuring.
          </p>

          <h5 class="section-title">Storage, Security, and Transfer of Data</h5>
          <p>
            Your personal data is stored securely with U.S.-based hosting providers. We employ reasonable measures to
            protect your data, but no system can be 100% secure. Data may be transferred to other countries, including
            outside the United States, where it may be processed and stored. By using our services, you consent to this
            transfer.
          </p>

          <h5 class="section-title">How Long We Store Data</h5>
          <p>
            We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
            collected. This may vary based on the type of information and the relationship you have with us.
          </p>

          <h5 class="section-title">Transmission of Personal Data</h5>
          <p>
            When you provide your personal information, you consent to its transmission across international borders for
            processing. We take steps to ensure that your data remains protected during these transfers.
          </p>

          <h5 class="section-title">How to Control Your Information</h5>
          <p>
            You have the right to access, delete, or restrict the use of your personal data. If you wish to exercise any
            of these rights, you can submit a verifiable consumer request by contacting us at the email provided below.

          <h5 class="section-title">Cookies</h5>

            Cookies are used to remember your preferences, track user sessions, and enable certain features, such as

          <h5 class="section-title">Tracking and Do Not Track Signals</h5>
          <p>
            We use tracking technologies such as Google Ads and Google Signals to analyze traffic and improve services.
            However, our platform does not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals. You can opt out of third-party
            tracking via Google or the Network Advertising Initiative.

            Our services are not directed toward children under 13 years old, and we do not knowingly collect
            information from them. If we become aware of any data from a minor, we will promptly delete it. If you
            believe we have collected such data, please contact us.
          </p>

          <h5 class="section-title">Effective Date and Modifications</h5>
